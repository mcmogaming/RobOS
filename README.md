# RobOS
RobOS is open source firmware for robots on ESP32 platform

Author: Mohammad Rahman

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the software stack used in the CSCC85 course by Paco Estrada. In that course
we built a 2 wheel lego EV3 robot and used a simple bluetooth api in C to control it and receive sensor data. 
RobOS was built to provide a similar experience for DIY robotics enthusiasts to write more code and worry less about
writing code for retrieving and filtering sensor data, multi threading/interrupts, and motor movement and PID loops.
