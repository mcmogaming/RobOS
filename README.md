# RobOS
RobOS is open source firmware for robots

## Inspiration
This project was inspired by the software stack used in the CSCC85 course by Paco Estrada. In this course
we used EV3 lego robots and a simple bluetooth api for controlling the robot. I hope to provide a stream
line experience for new users to robotics.
